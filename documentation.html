<h2>Fast-Food and Socio Economic Factors</h2>
The goal of this data analysis is to try and identify if fast-food restaurants are dispropotionalty targeting poor areas as measured by the poverty rate (shown on plot 1) or the median income (shown on plot 2). 

The source of the data is the <a href=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/>USDA Food Environment Atlas</a> which combines data from mutliple sources obtained between 2007 and 2010. 

<h2>How to use!</h2>

Simply choose one or more states in the input box. Once selected, the server will automatically calulate and display the county values on the two plots. Plot 1 shows the fast per 100 residents by % of residents below the federal poverty line. Plot 2 shows the number against the median household income. 


<h2>Correlation Tests</h2>

Correlation between the factors (poverty rate, and median household impact) were almost non existent. The plots demonstrate that as well. Thus, this is a failed expirement according to this dataset.
